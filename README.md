## This is the todo list 

This project is a simple To-Do List application built using TypeScript and vanilla JavaScript, with basic HTML and CSS for structure and styling. The app allows users to:

Add tasks to a list.
Delete tasks from the list.
Mark tasks as completed by disabling the delete button and underlining the text.
The purpose of this app is to demonstrate dynamic DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic interactivity using vanilla JavaScript/TypeScript.

Ensure you have the following file structure:
```
/project-root
